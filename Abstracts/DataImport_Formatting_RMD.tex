\#Data Import

Files are imported in to the easyRpopgen application through the poppr R
package. The preferred input format is the GenAlex file format, which
gives the user the ability to easily include population metadata for
their samples without uploading additional files, though users can also
import STRUCTURE files. Poppr can additionally handle FSTAT, GENETIX
file import, which we will address in future updates of the application.
Below we detail how data must be formatted for import into the
application.

\#\#\#GeneAlEx Format (.csv / .xlsx)

The best practice of GeneAlEx data formatting is detailed thoroughly in
the poppr user manual
(\url{https://grunwaldlab.github.io/Population_Genetics_in_R/Data_Preparation.html}).
This application utilizes the \emph{poppr} import functionality for
this, so consult this web link for further information. GeneAlEx files
are formatted with individuals in Rows and loci in Columns. The first
two rows and first two columns of the data frame are reserved for
summary descriptions of the data, as shown in the image below. Data MUST
be formatted as shown to be correctly read by the application. The first
three columns of row 1 must contain the number of loci, samples and
populations in the dataset, in that order. From the fourth column onward
users must define the populations within their data (row 2), and the
number of individuals within each population (row 1), matched by column.
Users can define as many populations as they wish but these must be
represented in the `Pop' column. Users can also optionally include a
project ID within the second row of column A, which can be used as the
project ID for all downloaded files from the application.

For loci, each column represents an allele. Loci can be defined by one
(haploid) or two (diploid) columns. The poppr application can handle
multiple (multiploid) columns though it is not recommended as
easyRpopgen is optimized for diploid data and multiploid data may not be
handled well by some R packages, resulting in misinterpretation of the
data. Missing data for a locus or allele must be coded with a zero (0).

Note for microsatellite data: When working with microsatellite data each
locus will be coded using multiple numbers for each allele (e.g.~contigA
Allele A = 157, ContigA Allele B = 137). In this case missing values
MUST BE CODED WITH A SIGNLE ZERO AND NOT MULTIPLE ZEROS or it will NOT
be read as missing data by the import function, and will result in
mis-analysis of your data. Make sure to check your .csv file in a basic
text reader such as `notepad' for this- it will not show up if you are
viewing your input file in excel.
