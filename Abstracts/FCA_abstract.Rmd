Factorial correspondence analysis is an extension of PCA, which can be used to explore relationships
among qualitative (or categorical) data. This is not however necessarily how it is implemented in
population genetics. The principles of FCA are:
- Genetic data are transformed into a contingency table (samples x alleles) where each sample
is described by allelic frequencies.
- Chi-squared distance centred on the marginal distribution of the contingency table is used to
measure the relatedness between any two samples in k -dimensional space (k - number of
alleles).
- Resulting factorial axes can be ordered according to their eigenvalues and the first axis
corresponding to the largest eigenvalue explains the more general pattern or structure
contained in the data set.
