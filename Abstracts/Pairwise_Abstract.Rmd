To calculate a pairwise matrix of values, the dataset is split into unique pairs of populations. e.g. a study contains Pop1, Pop2 and Pop3 andfor pairwise comparisons the dataset is split
in to Pop1-Pop2, Pop1-Pop3, and Pop2-Pop-3. 

Statistical significance between the value for each pair
can then tested through permutation calculations of the value to assess the likelihood that it deviates
from zero using Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo testing. Pairwise values can also be used to construct
phylogenetic trees as they represent evolutionary distances between samples.
